              <h1>Assignment 8: Soldering</h1>
              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>
                Solder a small circuit and create the schematic. </p>
              <p>
              A snippet of the schematic:
              </p>

              <img src="A8_Circuit.jpg" height=400></a>
              </p>
              <p>
                The wires on my DC motor were not securely soldered initially so during my first use of it, the wires suddenly fell off. I had the solder both of the wires back on. The schematic I drew is of a circuit in which my motor is connect to ground and power. </p>
