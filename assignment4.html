                Create a schematic, circuit, and code that uses a transistor to control load power separate from logic power. Use analogWrite(), a high-load output device, and an input sensor.              <p>

              A snippet of the schematic:

              Assuming that 200mA of current can flow through the photoresistor, it is calcuated to require 25 Ohms of resistance. I used the 10k Ohm resistor. I used the power equation (thank you internet) to calculate the current from the LED strip I used with 87 LEDs. With the current, I was able to calculate that the 11.6 Ohms of resistance is needed so I used the 10k resistor.

                I used the blue LED and connected it to pin 9, with a photoresistor connected to A0 for measurement. The circuit is connected to 5V and ground.

              Here's my code:
              </p>
              <pre>
              <code>

      const int analogInPin = A0;  // Analog input pin that the photoresistor is attached to
      const int LED = 9; // Analog output pin that the LED Strip is attached to

      int sensorValue = 0;        // value read from the photoresistor
      int outputValue = 0;        // value output to the PWM (analog out)

      void setup() {
        Serial.begin(9600);       // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:
        pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);       // initializing the LED Strip as output
        pinMode(analogInPin, INPUT);        // Initializing the photoresistor as input
      }

      void loop() {
        sensorValue = analogRead(analogInPin);        // read the analog in value
        outputValue = map(sensorValue, 0, 50, 0, 255);        // map the sensor value to the LED Strip

        if (outputValue > 200) {       // if the output value is greater than 200, turn the LED Strip on
          analogWrite(LED, 0);        // write LED Strip on
          Serial.print("LED IS ON WITH OUTPUT VALUE OF ");       // write to the serial monitor that the LED Strip is on and show output value
          Serial.println(outputValue);
        } else if (outputValue <= 200) {        // if the output value is equal to or less than 200, turn the LED Strip off
          analogWrite(LED, 255);      // write LED off
          Serial.println("BLUE LED IS OFF WITH VALUE OF ");        // write to the serial monitor that the LED Strip is off and show output value
          Serial.println(outputValue);
        }
        // wait 2 milliseconds before the next loop for the analog-to-digital
        // converter to settle after the last reading:
        delay(2);
      }
               </code>

              See it in action:

                My LED strip seemed to be a little funky so it wasn't as bright as when I tried to build the circuit in class.
